# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I wanted to complete this project fully and study/practice it, as i felt that any knowledge i could get now would give me a head start when the bootcamp begins.
- Why did you build this project?
- I built this project to learn the bare basics of the skills i will learn and practice for the next 6 months.
- It gives me a centralized place to store notes I've learned so far, as well as a place to reference links for specific language material/knowledge/study material
- I learned that actually building a website isnt that hard in concept - just have to know the building blocks!
- I learned a lot about git as well and the git flow process, I get heavy hints that it will be important in this course and important in being a developer overall.
- This project also inspired me with a new goal - I like the idea of hosting my own note taking knowledge learnt so far in website form, but I feel like in practical terms it would take a lot of work to take notes this way - by building the HTML block by block, etc just to add notes. So, my goal is, maybe as the bootcamps moves on I can build a simple website that I host myself that will allow me to take notes on the fly, just by typing it into the website and it auto adds what I save to itn to my list of notes. Would be cool to build something like that and then actively use it myself or even share with others.
- I also seemed to get a hint that ReadMe's like this will be important to the class for grading etc, so I saved a template of it in this repo for future use.

## Usage

Use this website to study knowledge learned so far. It is possible to use it as the bootcamp goes on by adding information to it, or even using it as a template instead to make more note pages to cover knowledge on various different topics.
