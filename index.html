          <li>CSS is used to provide styling to a webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS can be applied to a specific element in HTML, such as paragraphs p, unordered lists ul, etc. </li>
          <li>think of each element as a "box" and we can define the parameters and colors of that box</li>
          <li>margin is the space around that box/element</li>
          <li>padding is extra space around the content inside the box/element</li>
          <li>we can also assign classes to stuff in HTML and then apply CSS to specific HTML class</li>
          <li>the sections in this webpage defined as a card class in html and we edited all card classes via CSS.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>is "card" a type of class specifically, or can we call the classes wheatever we want?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>the CSS stylesheet must be linked to the HTML code</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"> here</a> is a useful link for CSS code </li>

          <li>Some useful commands related to branches:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git checkout: switchest to a specified branch</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>the -b switch creats a new branch at the same time and switches to it. syntax: </li>
                  <li>git checkout -b new-branch-name</li>
                </ul>
                <li>git pull updates your current branch from the repo, or the branch you specify</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>what does "origin do exactly? syntax:</li>
                    <li>git pull origin main</li>
                  </ul>
              <li>git add -A commits all local files to the current branch</li>
              <li>git commit -m "message" commits the current branch to repo, -m switch addes a description</li>
              <li>at this point rememebr to frequently do git pull origin main so you always have the up to date main branch to avoid collab errors/working on outdated code</li>
              <li>git push origin branch-name-here pushes the branch to the repo</li>
              <ul>
                <li>whats the difference between commit and push in this context here?</li>
              </ul>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          <li>be sure to review <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow">this guide</a> </li>
          <li>and reference module 2.4.5 as well as 3.1.6 of the prework course for github flow. I feel like ill need to practice this a lot.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>here is a good git flow reference until you memorize:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>make sure you are in the branch you want to be with git checkout branch-name-here</li>
              <li>select/add all changed files to the branch with git add -A</li>
              <li>commit the changes to your local branch with git committ -m "message here"</li>
              <li>as always, make sure your local main branch is updateed with git pull origin main</li>
              <li>push your local branch to the repo with git push origin branch-name-here</li>
              <li>create a pull request with your branch on the repo, owner will approve and merge it</li>
            </ol>

          <li>My previous studies helped alot here, the first JS lesson was easy with concepts I already knew</li>
          <li>I did however learn how to do a for loop, that was cool.</li>
          <li>here are some more notes from what I leanred here:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>remember that template literalls $() have to begin/end with the tilde key: `</li>
            <li>JS is an OOP language - Object Oriented Porgramming</li>

          <li>functions are useful - practice them</li>
          <li>need to link the mozilla JS reference site here, and specifically the math functions part as they take some thinking over to understand.</li>
